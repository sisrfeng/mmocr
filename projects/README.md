# Projects

Implementing new models and features into OpenMMLab's algorithm libraries could be troublesome due to the rigorous requirements on code quality, which could hinder the fast iteration of SOTA models and might discourage our members from sharing their latest outcome here.

And that's why we have this `Projects/` folder now, where some experimental features, frameworks and models are placed, only needed to satisfy the minimum requirement on the code quality, and can be used as standalone libraries. Users are welcome to use them if they [use MMOCR from source](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/get_started/install.html#best-practices).

Everyone is welcome to post their implementation of any great ideas in this folder! If you wish to start your own project, please go through the [example project](example_project/) for the best practice.

Note: The core maintainers of MMOCR only ensure the results are reproducible and the code quality meets its claim at the time each project was submitted, but they may not be responsible for future maintenance. The original authors take responsibility for maintaining their own projects.
